								<h3>Brightbird</h3>
								<p>I've been self-employed since 2015 with my one-man company Brightbird. I work full-stack with web development, working with Node.js, Ruby on Rails and React. I also define databases and build APIs. On the analytics side I've worked on automated data flows and reports. When combining web development with analytics, I like working with Neo4j graph databases. Clients include ICA, Cineast, Aways, Goethe-Institute and Dreamler.</p>

								<h3>Technical project management</h3>
								<p>As lead for development projects, I enjoy defining requirements and iterative processes. I like working with teams to draw up road maps, release plans and strategies to overcome challenges. I've had this role in software projects for clients, in community open source projects and as project lead for a student research group in synthetic biology for the first iGEM Stockholm team, which I co-founded in 2015.</p>

								<h3>Dreams</h3>
								<p>Dreams is a platform to plan co-created events. I originally led developement of Dreams for the event Urban Burn Stockholm in 2016 and continued development on it for the event The Borderland that same year, after which I adapted it to be more generally usable by other events. It was then used for Midburnerot 2016 then Midburn 2017 in Israel. Dreams is now mainly being developed by the Metaburn community and the Isreali Midburn team, and has become an international open source project.</p>

								<h3>Realities</h3>
								<p>Realities is a tool to assign roles and responsibilities that generates graphs showing what the actual dependencies and relations are between different roles. It's suitable for groups without hierarchical organisational charts. A common problem in such organisations is that it becomes  difficult to understand who the stakeholders for an issue are. Realities shows you a graph of how stakeholders relate to what you are interested in, answering who you should contact if you wish to make a decision.</p>

								<h3>Edgeryders</h3>
								<p>I work with Edgeryders, a company living in symbiosis with an online community of thousands of hackers, activists, radical thinkers and doers, and just normal people that want to make a difference. Our core mission is to enable collective intelligence. My focus is on entrepreneurship within the Edgeryders frame, specifically focusing on the innovative tech being developed for online ethnography.</p>

								<h3>Syntheist Node</h3>
								<p>The Syntheist Node in Stockholm is a communal space for participatoru culture. It's a radical experiment in community building. We're creating a temple, a playground, a space for workshops, a space for music and a perma-burn, all at once and free for everyone. I'm on the board of the Node and responsible for the finances.</p>

								<h3>The Borderland</h3>
								<p>The Borderland is a participatory event, a collaborative community where we co-create events and gatherings as prototypes for our dreams. The purpose of The Borderland is to shorten the distance between dream and reality. It is a place where neither exist, and both exist. At the same time. I'm on the board and engaged here, turning nuts and bolts. </p>
